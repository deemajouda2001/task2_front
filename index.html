    <p>
        Gaza City is the largest city in the Gaza Strip, a narrow piece of land along the Mediterranean Sea in the Middle East. <br>
         It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with a history dating back over 4,000 years.   <br>
        The city is known for its cultural, historical, and economic significance, but it also faces significant challenges due to ongoing conflicts and blockades. <br>
         Despite this, Gaza City remains a vibrant hub of Palestinian life, with bustling markets, ancient landmarks, and a strong, resilient community.
